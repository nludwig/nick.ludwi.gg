I've been reading Slate Star Codex for a few years now, and recently got a Kindle ereader.
So naturally I thought it'd be a good idea to scrape SSC and convert the scrape into a set of ebooks.

You can find the resulting code and scrape (as of 201122) at
[my Github](https://github.com/nludwig/scrape-blog)
or below.

In particular, you will find a set of `.docx` files as well as some `.mobi` ereader format files.
I've chosen to divide the scrape by year.
You'll find that most of the images of the blog have been scraped, and that the blog entries are represented in the `.mobi` ebooks as "chapters" that are accessible via the "Go to" menu (at least for Kindle).

I've enjoyed the blog for a number of years and look forward to reading it on my ereader.
I hope you enjoy it as well!

(I should explicitly note that I did not write SSC, I'm just a fan.)
