Hi!

I'm Nick.
These days, I'm employed by
[Remeeting](https://www.remeeting.com),
where I write code and think about ASR.
In the past, I studied complex liquid systems using
computer simulation techniques like molecular dynamics
and Monte Carlo (my favorite).
And before that, I studied chemistry!
You can find some of my past work on
[my Github](https://www.github.com/nludwig)
or [here on my webpage](/posts/papers).

When I'm not working, I like to read, write, and hike.
My reading interests are pretty broad.
You can find a non-exhaustive list of some of
the books I've enjoyed recently [here](/posts/books).
